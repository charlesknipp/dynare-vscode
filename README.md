# Dynare for Visual Studio Code
This extension provides syntax highlighting for Dynare models, enhancing readability and coding efficiency.

## Installing

To enable syntax highlighting for `mod` files in vscode, you must do the following steps:
1. `ctrl + shift + p` and search for `Developer: Install Extension from Location...`
2. Select the repository
3. Reload the window
